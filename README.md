# Project03 Juicy Match-3

This was our third project for MSCH-C220, a match-3 game with a focus on making the elements more "juicy". Completed on 3/2/2022.

## Implementation

Created using [Godot 3.4.2](https://godotengine.org/download)

Sprites are from the [Animal Pack Redux, provided by kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets/animal-pack-redux)

Sound effects were created by me using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), with the help of my Wii, my GameCube controller, and my keyboard.

Music was also created by me using [MuseScore](https://musescore.com/).
